Step 2: Find the repository URL
- Visit the GitHub website or any other Git hosting platform where the repository is located.
- Navigate to the repository you want to clone.
- Click on the "Code" or "Clone" button, which will display the repository's URL. It will typically be in the form of "https://github.com/username/repository.git".
